      "query": "How do I analyze a stock before investing?",
      "response": "To analyze a stock before investing, you should look at both quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative analysis includes examining financial statements, key ratios (P/E, P/B, ROE, etc.), revenue growth, profit margins, and debt levels. Qualitative analysis involves understanding the company's business model, competitive advantage, management quality, industry trends, and potential risks. It's also helpful to review analyst reports, recent news, and the company's future growth prospects."

      "query": "What is the difference between fundamental and technical analysis?",
      "response": "Fundamental analysis evaluates a stock's intrinsic value by examining the company's financial health, industry position, and economic factors. It focuses on factors like revenue, earnings, growth potential, and management quality to determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued. Technical analysis, on the other hand, studies price movements and trading volumes through charts and patterns to predict future price behavior. Technical analysts believe that historical price patterns tend to repeat, allowing them to identify entry and exit points based on market psychology and momentum."

      "query": "How should I diversify my portfolio?",
      "response": "Portfolio diversification involves spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to reduce risk. A well-diversified portfolio might include a mix of stocks (across various sectors and market caps), bonds (government and corporate), real estate, and potentially alternative investments like commodities or cryptocurrencies. The specific allocation depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. A common approach is to have more equities when you're younger and gradually shift toward fixed income as you near retirement."
